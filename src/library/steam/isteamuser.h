	// by most applications. It is raw single-channel 16-bit PCM wave data which
	// may have been run through preprocessing filters and/or had silence removed,
	// so the uncompressed audio could have a shorter duration than you expect.
	// There may be no data at all during long periods of silence. Also, fetching
	// uncompressed audio will cause GetVoice to discard any leftover compressed
	// audio, so you must fetch both types at once. Finally, GetAvailableVoice is
	// not precisely accurate when the uncompressed size is requested. So if you
	// really need to use uncompressed audio, you should call GetVoice frequently
	// with two very large (20kb+) output buffers instead of trying to allocate
	// perfectly-sized buffers. But most applications should ignore all of these
	// details and simply leave the "uncompressed" parameters as NULL/zero.
