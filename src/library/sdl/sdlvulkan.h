/**
 * Get the address of the `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` function.
 *
 * This should be called after either calling SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary() or
 * creating an SDL_Window with the `SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN` flag.
 *
 * The actual type of the returned function pointer is
 * PFN_vkGetInstanceProcAddr, but that isn't available because the Vulkan
 * headers are not included here. You should cast the return value of this
 * function to that type, e.g.
 *
 * `vkGetInstanceProcAddr =
 * (PFN_vkGetInstanceProcAddr)SDL_Vulkan_GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr();`
 *
 * \returns the function pointer for `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` or NULL on
 *          failure; call SDL_GetError() for more information.
 *
 * \since This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
