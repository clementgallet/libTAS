# Introduction

So you have learnt about the existence of libTAS and you are really excited to
TAS some of your favourite PC games but you don't have a computer running a
Linux-based operating system or you simply want to stick with your Windows OS.
In that case, using the Windows Subsystem for Linux is probably the most
efficient approach.

This guide is meant for people who have very little or no experience with Linux
so I will take things slowly.

By the way, Linux is a family of operating systems - the one we are going to
use specifically is Ubuntu. First off, let's take a look at the entire setup

libTAS can't run natively on Windows. Thus, we use WSL 2 to create an
environment that lets us execute Linux-based code. Effectively, this will give
us a terminal in which we can do a lot of things given we know the commands.
For many Windows users this is usually an uncomfortable experience - they'd
rather have a nice graphical user interface (GUI) with lots of things to click on.
As it happens, libTAS does come with a GUI. Recent versions of WSL 2 come with a
native graphics server (WSLg) that we will be using as our first option. If that
does not work, there is an alternative using vcxsrv (see step 3).

Summed up, we have a Windows 10 running WSL 2 running libTAS through an X-Server.
A bit convoluted, but more efficient than using a VM! And once everything is
installed and set up, it's only a few clicks and you are ready to TAS.

Things you will need to download:

* [Ubuntu](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pdxgncfsczv)
* [libTAS](https://github.com/clementgallet/libTAS/releases)

And of course, you will need a game that runs on Linux.

# Step 1: Installing & Setting Up WSL 2 

I think [Microsoft's guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps) did a decent job explaining the installation process so I just refer to that here. If however you do happen to run into trouble, feel free to join the [libTAS discord server](https://discord.gg/3MBVAzU) and ask for help. Optionally, you can also find tutorials on YouTube.

You can check that you have the version 2 installed by running the following command in a Windows terminal: `wsl --list --verbose`. If it prints `1` at `VERSION`, then you need to upgrade to version 2.

Once WSL 2 has been installed, grab Ubuntu from the store (this is all mentioned in Microsoft's guide but I just
want to point it out here again). You should have a new Windows-App called Ubuntu.

Start it and a terminal will open. For the first time only you'll be asked to
create a [user account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/user-support) which will be your default user.

If you like to adjust your terminal, right-click on the top bar to open a menu and select properties at the bottom.
Here you can adjust the copy&paste behaviour, font size, colours and other things. Generally, if you want to paste something, you can just right-click anywhere on the console.

Now it's time to check for updates. Paste this into your terminal and hit enter:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade

`sudo` stands for "super user do" which is basically admin powers. `sudo apt update`
checks for updates and `sudo apt upgrade` is for actually updating. Confirm and
wait for the updates to finish.

# Step 2: Installing libTAS

Next we are going to install libTAS. You can access files outside of Ubuntu
by mounting your harddrive which is very convenient. This means you can just
download libTAS on your Windows environment, then access it in the terminal.
It is recommended that you place the .deb file somewhere convenient because
you will have to fill in its path in the terminal using the cd command.

For example:

    cd /mnt/d/libTAS
    
would change the current directory to D:\libTAS on Windows (do pay attention to
the different pathing style). For paths with spaces, escape the spaces with a
backslash '\\' or put the whole thing in quotes.

Change directory to where you've put the .deb file, then run

    sudo dpkg -i ./libtas_*_amd64.deb

The `*` is a glob, which will be filled in with the correct version, e.g.
it may be named `libtas_1.4.0_d086878_amd64.deb` and it will still work. Very convenient.

Potentially you will see error messages saying that there are unmet dependencies.
The easiest way to fix that is to simply run

    sudo apt --fix-broken install

and it will install a lot of stuff. Hopefully that should be it and libTAS has been installed.

Now if you run

    libTAS

a window should pop and you should see libTAS in all its glory!

# Step 3: Installing & Setting Up VcXsrv as an alternative

If using libTAS with the native WSLg server does cause issues when TASing 
(currently mouse issues have been reported), you may want to use 
[VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) as an alternative.

Install VcXsrv on Windows, then run `xlaunch.exe` located in the installation folder. 
Your firewall will most likely want to block it. Permit access both on private
and public networks. You may want to go into your firewall's settings and double check.

Now we are going to configure the X-Server. On the first screen, change "Display number" to 0.
"Multiple windows" is picked by default and useful for our needs because you
will have multiple windows (libTAS, your game, RAM search/watch, Input Editor etc).

On the second screen, select "Start no client". We start our programs in due time.

On the third screen, uncheck "Native opengl" and check "Disable access control".

On the fourth screen you can save these settings so you can launch them similarly
to a normal shortcut which is very convenient for later.

Confirm and start your X-Server. 

There will be an icon in your taskbar's corner and a process called 
"VcXsrv windows xserver" in your Task-Manager shall you need to kill it.

Now to connect WSL with our server, paste

    export DISPLAY=$(awk '/nameserver / {print $2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2>/dev/null):0

to the terminal. Now, running libTAS should use VcXsrv as the graphics server.

However the export thing is necessary every time you start Ubuntu. There is a
convenient way to have it run automatically by typing said export line into a 
file called `.bashrc`. To append the command in that file, copy the following command:

    echo "export DISPLAY=\$(awk '/nameserver / {print \$2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2>/dev/null):0" >> ~/.bashrc

Now if you've done everything correctly, the next time you open a terminal and
run libTAS, it should pop up right away without having to run the export
command first (make sure that your X-Server is running of course).

# Step 5: Installing Steam (optional)

If your game has a Linux version and exists on Steam, then the easiest way to
get the files of the game you want to TAS would be to simply install Steam and download it.
There are some ways to directly access Steam repositories but I am not familiar with that. So run

    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 # allows WSL to access 32 bit repos
    sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install steam

and it should install Steam. Download your game, then launch it through libTAS.
