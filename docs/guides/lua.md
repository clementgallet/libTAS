### Gui functions

Gui functions are only valid in callback `onPaint()`. **Beware**, option
`Video > OSD > Lua` needs to be checked to show any lua draw function.
In all gui functions, colors are coded in a single 32-bit unsigned integer as followed: `0xaarrggbb`.

#### gui.resolution

    (number width, number height) gui.resolution()

Returns the width and height of game window. 

#### gui.text

    none gui.text(Number x, Number y, String text, [Number color = 0xffffffff], [Number anchor_x = 0], [Number anchor_y = 0], [Number font_size = 16], [Number monospace = false])
    
Draws text string `text` at position `(x, y)`. The text will be colored using
color `color` and size of `font_size`.
The part of the text string that is positioned at `(x, y)` is determined by `anchor_x`
and `anchor_y` values that are bound between 0 and 1. For example, setting
`anchor_x = 0` (default value) will print left-aligned text and `anchor_x = 1` will
print right-aligned text. If `monospace` is set to a non-zero value, a monospace
font will be used instead of the regular font.

#### gui.window

    none gui.window(Number x, Number y, String id, String text)
    
Draws an ImGui window containing the text string `text` at position `(x, y)`. The
text can contain newline characters.

If `id` is empty, the window will appear without any decoration and will be fixed.
If `id` is non-empty, the window will appear with a title, and can be moved freely
by the user. In that case, the `(x, y)` position is interpreted as startup position.

When displaying multiple windows, you must use unique ids (when not empty).

#### gui.pixel

    none gui.pixel(Number x, Number y, [Number color = 0xffffffff]) 

Draws pixel at (x,y) using color `color`.

#### gui.line

    none gui.line(Number x0, Number y0, Number x1, Number y1, [Number color = 0xffffffff])

Draws an antialiased line starting from `(x0,y0)` to `(x1,y1)`, and colored with color `color`.

#### gui.rectangle

    none gui.rectangle(Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h, [Number thickness = 1], [Number color = 0xffffffff], [Number filled = 0])

Draws rectangle of size `(w,h)` with top-left corner at `(x,y)`. Outline is of thickness `thickness` and is colored with color `color`. If `filled` is true, the rectangle is filled with the same color.

#### gui.quad

    none gui.ellipse(Number x0, Number y0, Number x1, Number y1, Number x2, Number y2, Number x3, Number y3, [Number thickness = 1], [Number color = 0xffffffff], [Number filled = 0])

Draws a quad that goes through the four points `(x0,y0)`, `(x1,y1)`, `(x2,y2)`, `(x3,y3)`. Outline is of thickness `thickness` and is colored with color `color`. If `filled` is true, the quad is filled with the same color.

#### gui.ellipse

    none gui.ellipse(Number center_x, Number center_y, Number radius_x, Number radius_y, [Number thickness = 1], [Number color = 0xffffffff], [Number filled = 0])

Draws an antialiased ellipse whose center is `(center_x,center_y)`, radius along x-axis is `radius_x` and radius along y-axis is `radius_y`, colored with color `color`.

### Movie functions

#### movie.currentFrame

    Number movie.currentFrame()

Returns the current frame number.

#### movie.frameCount

### Runtime functions

Runtime functions must be performed in callback `onFrame()` to be effective on
the current frame.

#### runtime.saveState

    none runtime.saveState(Number slot)

Save a state in slot number `slot` (must be between 1 and 10). Beware, savestate
operations are registered but not executed instantly, they will be performed after
this callback.

#### runtime.loadState

    none runtime.loadState(Number slot)

Load a state in slot number `slot` (must be between 1 and 10). The loading behaviour
depends on the status of the current movie. Beware, savestate operations are
registered but not executed instantly, they will be performed after this callback.

#### runtime.isFastForward

    Number runtime.isFastForward()

Returns if fast-forward is checked.

#### runtime.setFastForward

    none runtime.setFastForward(Number ff)

Set the fast-forward status.

#### runtime.sleepMS

    none runtime.sleepMS(Number length)

Sleep for `length` milliseconds.

### Callbacks

#### callback.onStartup

    None callback.onStartup(Function f)

Registers `f` to be called when the game has started, before the end of the first frame.

#### callback.onInput

    None callback.onInput(Function f)

Registers `f` to be called when input for the current frame is decided. It will 
change the inputs inside the current movie in recording mode **and** playback 
mode. It will also apply when no movie is loaded, or if the movie playback 
reached the end.

#### callback.onFrame

    None callback.onFrame(Function f)

Registers `f` to be called after frame has completed.

#### callback.onPaint

    None callback.onPaint(Function f)

Registers `f` to be called at the end of the frame before the screen rendering 
is performed. **Beware**, if the current frame is a non-draw frame, or if the
current frame rendering is skipped due to fast-forward, the callback is **not**
called, to improve fast-forward efficiency. All Gui functions must be
executed inside this callback. To include Lua draws in encodes, 
`Video > OSD > OSD on video encode` can be checked.

### Callbacks (obsolete)

The old callback method consists on defining functions with specific names above,
which will be called at specific moments during the game execution.

#### onStartup

Called when the game has started, before the end of the first frame.

#### onInput

Called when input for the current frame is decided. Change the movie input if
in recording mode. Not called when movie is in playback mode.

#### onFrame

Called just as the current frame has completed. All runtime functions must be
executed here if you want them to be executed on the current frame.

#### onPaint

Called at the end of the frame before the screen rendering is performed. All Gui
functions must be executed inside this callback. To include Lua draws in encodes,
`Video > OSD > OSD on video encode` can be checked.
